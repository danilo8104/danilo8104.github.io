	  <h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

    <p><strong>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.</strong></p>

    <p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)
    175g of tahini
    6 sundried tomatoes<br>
    Half a red pepper<br>
    <em>A pinch of cayenne pepper</em><br>
    1 clove of garlic<br>
    A dash of olive oil</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <p>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely<br>
    Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely<br>
	<em>Add all the ingredients into a food processor<br></em>
	<em>Process all the ingredients into a paste.<br></em>
	<em>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time<br></em>
	<em>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time<br></em>

    For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.<br>

    Storage<br>

    Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.<br>

    Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>
